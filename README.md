Setting Up an Apache Server and Analyzing HTTP Traffic

Objective:
To gain hands-on experience with web server deployment and HTTP traffic 
analysis by setting up an Apache server, customizing its content, and using Wireshark to 
capture and analyze HTTP requests.

Overview:
In this task, you will install and configure an Apache web server on your 
machine. You will customize the server's default page to display your full name. Next, you 
will use curl to make an HTTP request to the server and analyze the traffic using Wireshark 
to capture the transmitted data.

Tasks:
1. Setting Up an Apache Web Server:
Research how to install Apache on your operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, 
CentOS).
Install and configure the Apache server.
Replace the content of the default Apache web page with your full name.

2. Retrieving Customized Content Using curl:
Use the curl command to send an HTTP GET request to your Apache server.   
Ensure that the response displays your full name, confirming the server is 
correctly serving the customized content.

3. Sniffing HTTP Traffic Using Wireshark:
Install and configure Wireshark on your machine.
Capture the network traffic during the curl request.
Analyze the captured traffic, focusing on how your full name is transmitted 
over the network.

Deliverables:
PDF Report that includes:
Step-by-step instructions used to set up the Apache server and customize 
the default page.
The process of initiating an HTTP request using curl.
Analysis and insights from the Wireshark capture, specifically highlighting 
the transmission of your full name.
Any challenges encountered during the task and how they were resolved.

Wireshark captures that clearly display your full name within the HTTP 
traffic, including visible IPs/URLs.

Hints: 
Pay attention to the HTTP protocol, especially how headers and content are 
transmitted.
Document each configuration step, noting the reasons behind your choices.
Ensure your Wireshark capture includes all relevant details, such as IP addresses 
and URLs.
